So testing the email sending got me thinking of a way to automate checking mailinator for multiple email addresses. I wrote a quick app in GAE that will let you check mailinator addresses using their RSS feeds. If you install and run it, just put in the usernames you want to check (it automatically appends @mailinator.com) and click start. It will refresh every 5 seconds and will show the 5 most recent messages.
